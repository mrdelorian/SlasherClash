# SlasherClash

Slasher Clash Off is pretty much a face off or fight of horror monsters

As of 3/5/2025 - 12:00am, I cannot get this to work/look well on mobile, so for now, I'm keeping this looking good only on PC

Fixed mobile view for horizontal and vertical viewing (9/14/2025)

Added randomization to the matches/face offs (9/14/2025)

Renamed to SlasherClash (9/15/2025)

Added a tournament mode, in the form of a March Madness type event, next to the normal mode (9/15/2025 night)
